Doxia Sitetool Site Model

 This is strictly the model for Doxia Sitetool Site Model, used in maven-site-plugin as <<<site.xml>>> to inject
 parameters into site template: see {{{../doxia-site-renderer/}Doxia Site Renderer}} for more details on site rendering.

 The following are generated from this model:

   * {{{./apidocs/index.html}Java sources}} with Reader and Writers for the Xpp3 XML parser

   * A {{{./site.html}Descriptor Reference}}

   * An XSD referenced in the {{{./site.html}Descriptor Reference}}.

* Inheritance

 Site model can be merged from a parent <<<site.xml>>> into a child <<<site.xml>>> using
 <<<SiteModelInheritanceAssembler>>> ({{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/doxia/site/inheritance/SiteModelInheritanceAssembler.html}javadoc}})
 with its <<<DefaultSiteModelInheritanceAssembler>>> implementation
 ({{{./xref/org/apache/maven/doxia/site/inheritance/DefaultSiteModelInheritanceAssembler.html}source}}).

* Interpolation

 Interpolation is not done here: see {{{../doxia-integration-tools/} Doxia Integration Tools}} documentation for more details.
