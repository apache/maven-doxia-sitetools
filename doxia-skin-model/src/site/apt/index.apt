Doxia Sitetools Skin Model

 This is strictly the model for Doxia Sitetools Skin Model, used in skins in <<<META-INF/maven/skin.xml>>>.

 The following are generated from this model:

   * {{{./apidocs/index.html}Java sources}} with Reader for the Xpp3 XML parser

   * A {{{./skin.html}Descriptor Reference}}

   * An XSD referenced in the {{{./skin.html}Descriptor Reference}}.

* Doxia Sitetools Skin

  A Doxia Sitetools skin must contain a Velocity template named <<<META-INF/maven/site.vm>>>: it will be called
  by {{{../doxia-site-renderer/index.html}Site Renderer}} with additional variables about the
  rendered document as documented in the {{{../doxia-site-renderer/index.html#Site_Template}Site Template section}},
  the main variable being <<<bodyContent>>>.

  Maven team provides {{{/skins/}a collection of skins}} for projects use.

  Some documentation is available on {{{/plugins/maven-site-plugin/examples/creatingskins.html}how to create a new skin}},
  by copying other skins to benefit from examples of breadcrumbs or menu generation from
  {{{../doxia-site-model/index.html}site model}}.

  Since Doxia Sitetools 1.7, a skin descriptor can be added in <<<META-INF/maven/skin.xml>>>.
