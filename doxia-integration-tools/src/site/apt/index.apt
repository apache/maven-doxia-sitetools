Maven Doxia Integration Tools

  This shared component has some utilities that are useful when integrating Doxia in Maven,
  mainly for site generation and report creation.

  The main entry point is the
  {{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/doxia/tools/SiteTool.html}SiteTool}} Plexus component.

* Usage

  Instructions on how to use the integration of Doxia in Maven can be found {{{./usage.html}here}}.

* <<<site.xml>>> Model Interpolation

  Interpolation of {{{../doxia-site-model/site.html}<<<site.xml>>> model}} injects
  Maven project's information, replacing <<<$\{...\}>>> with calculated values
  like it happens in {{{/ref/current/maven-model-builder/#Model_Interpolation}Maven model interpolation}}.

  Interpolation can be <<late>> or <<early>>:

  * with <<late>> interpolation, replacement happens <<after>> inheritance. This is the classical behaviour in Maven pom,

  * with <<early>> interpolation, replacement happens <<before>> inheritance: this was the default behaviour for <<<project.*>>>
  values until Doxia Sitetools 1.7 (used in {{{/plugins/maven-site-plugin/history.html} Maven Site Plugin 3.5}}), when these early and late interpolation definitions didn't exist.
  Since Doxia Sitetools 1.7.1 (used in {{{/plugins/maven-site-plugin/history.html} Maven Site Plugin 3.5.1}}), early interpolation happens for <<<this.*>>> values.

  []

  Values are evaluated in sequence from different syntaxes:

*-----------------+--------------+--------------------+------------------+
|| late value     || early value || evaluation result || common examples ||
*-----------------+--------------+--------------------+------------------+
| <<<project.*>>> | <<<this.*>>> | POM content (see {{{/ref/current/maven-model/maven.html}POM reference}}) | <<<$\{project.version\}>>>\
                  |              |                    | <<<$\{this.url\}>>>
*-----------------+--------------+--------------------+------------------+
| <<<*>>>         | <<<this.*>>> | model properties, such as project properties set in the pom | <<<$\{any.key\}>>>\
                  |              |                    | <<<$\{this.any.key\}>>>
*-----------------+--------------+--------------------+------------------+
| <<<env.*>>>\
<<<*>>>           |              | environment variables | <<<$\{env.PATH\}>>>
*-----------------+--------------+--------------------+------------------+
